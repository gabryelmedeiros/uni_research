This repository is dedicated to my research project at university. The title of the project is "Encoding Updates in Federated Learning Using Generalized Bitplanes"

In the federated learning paradigm, diverse data sources are employed to learn about a single problem or model. Local instances are used to train/update the model locally. Each model update is sent to a central server that updates the global model. The global model is then redistributed to the devices. This iterative process continues until a convergence criterion is met.

This project aims to evaluate the use of representations using ternary bitplanes (generalized bitplanes) for model gradients. We will study and analyze their impact on the convergence of the learning process. Additionally, we intend to propose methods to randomize these representations and achieve stochastic encoding to provide some level of privacy.
